For other uses, see Crime (disambiguation), Criminal (disambiguation), and Criminals (disambiguation).
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.(1! The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and
universally accepted definition.) though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.!3] The most popular view is that crime is a category created by
law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal
offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state ("a public wrong"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by
raw)
The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.{5] What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each
relevant jurisdiction. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law nations no such comprehensive statute exists.
The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and
trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to
undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, death. Some jurisdictions sentence individuals to programs to emphasize or provide for their
rehabilitation while most jurisdictions sentence individuals with the goal of punishing them or a mix of the aforementioned practices [ctation needec]
Usually, to be classified as a crime, the “act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must — with certain exceptions — be accompanied by the "intention to do something
criminal" (mens rea).{4)
While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically
punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.

Overview

When informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired social order, a government or a state
may impose more formalized or stricter systems of social control. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal,
agents of the state can compel populations to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do
not conform

Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing
or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with
those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of
discouraging or preventing crime. In addition, authorities provide remedies and sanctions, and collectively these constitute
a criminal justice system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of
temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh
punishments: legal mutilation, capital punishment, or life without parole.

Usually, a natural person perpetrates a crime, but legal persons may also commit crimes. Historically, several premodern.
societies believed that non-human animals were capable of committing crimes, and prosecuted and punished them
accordingly.!61

The sociologist Richard Quinney has written about the relationship between society and crime. When Quinney states
“crime is a social phenomenon" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based
on societal norms.
Etymology

The word crime is derived from the Latin root cernd, meaning "I decide, | give judgment. Originally the Latin word crimen meant "charge" or “cry of distress”.{*! The
Ancient Greek word kpiua, krima, from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a
private or moral wrong."

In 13th century English crime meant “sinfulness", according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. It was probably brought to England as Old French crimne (12th century
form of Modern French crime), from Latin crimen (in the genitive case: criminis). in Latin, crimen could have signified any one of the following: "charge, indictment,
accusation; crime, fault, offense”

‘The word may derive from the Latin cernere — "to decide, to sift" (see crisis, mapped on Kairos and Chronos). But Ernest Klein (citing Karl Brugmann) rejects this and
suggests *crimen, which originally would have meant "cry of distress". Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in "cry" words and refers to English plaint, plaintiff, and so on.
The meaning "offense punishable by law" dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is glossed in Old English by facen, also "deceit, fraud, treachery", [cf. fake]
Crime wave is first attested in 1893 in American English.
Definition

‘Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission; it depends on
the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it{"°! An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by
what are called criminal proceedings. ("tl121

‘The following definition of crime was provided by the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871, and applied!"*! for the purposes of
section 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1908:

‘The expression "crime" means, in England and Ireland, any felony or the offence of uttering false or
counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by
false pretences, or the offence of conspiracy to defraud, or any misdemeanour under the fifty-eighth section of
the Larceny Act, 1861
Labelling theory

Further information: Labeling theory § The "criminal"
The label of “crime” and the accompanying social stigma normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the state,
including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of "crime" or “criminal” intend to assert the hegemony of a dominant

Population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the state (if standard processing tries and
convicts an accused person of a crime),
Natural-law theory

Justifying the state's use of force to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of
natural lav. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of morality or constructs them. Thomas Aquinas wrote in the 13th
century: "the rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts" !"8l He regarded people as by nature rational beings, concluding
that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and
coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s, William Blackstone described the thesis-{"9)

"This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. itis binding over all the globe, in all
countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately
or immediately, from this original."

But John Austin (1790-1859), an early positivist, applied utilitarianism in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He
denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms, a moral code can objectively determine what
people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utllty, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly,
H.LA. Hart saw the law as an aspect of sovereignty, with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.20)

‘Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal logic and consistency, and that the state's agents used state
power with responsibility. Ronald Dworkin rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them
as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of deference (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement,
which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which
a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.(2"]

There are natural-law theorists who have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law.22! This view entails the problem that it
makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as
morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.[25)

(One can solve this problem by granting some degree of moral relativism and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued
enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of state power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks
moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of individual rights

Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term right) rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws
(seen as man-made). Adam Smith illustrates this view, saying that a smuggler would be an excellent citizen, ".had not the laws of his country made that a crime which
nature never meant to be so."

Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between "criminality" (which derives from human nature) and "illegality" (which originates with the interests of those in power),

Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases malum in se and malum prohibitum respectively. They regard a “crime malum in se" as inherently criminal;
whereas a “crime malum prohibitum" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.

It follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many Enlightenment thinkers (such as
‘Adam Smith and the American Founding Fathers) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called classical liberals!@tion needed] ang

History

Some religious communities regard sin as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins — note the tale of
‘Adam and Eve and the theory of original sin. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. However, the earliest known civilizations had codes
of law, containing both civil and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form

Ancient Near East

‘The Sumerians produced the earliest surviving written codes.(?41 Urukagina (reigned c. 2380 BC — c. 2360 BC, short chronology) had an early code that has not,
survived; a later king, Ur-Nammu, left the earliest extant written law system, the Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100 — c. 2050 BC), which prescribed a formal system of penalties
for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the "code of Lipit-Ishtar". This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty
articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources.

‘The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No
wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.

—Kramer?5]

Successive legal codes in Babylon, including the code of Hammurabi (c. 1790 BC), reflected Mesopotamian society's belief that law derived from the will of the gods (see
Babylonian law).26127] Many states at this time functioned as theocracies, with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference. In the Sanskrit texts of
Dharmagastra (c. 1250 BC), issues such as legal and religious duties, code of conduct, penalties and remedies, etc. have been discussed and forms one of the
elaborate and earliest source of legal code.!81I231

Sir Henry Maine studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the "modern" sense of the word. while modern systems
distinguish between offences against the "state" or "community", and offences against the "individual", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with
"crimes" (Latin: crimina), but with "wrongs" (Latin: delicta). Thus the Hellenic laws treated all forms of theft, assault, rape, and murder as private wrongs, and left action
for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.!311132]

‘The Romans systematized law and applied their system across the Roman Empire. Again, the initial rules of Roman law regarded assaults as a matter of private
compensation. The most significant Roman law concept involved dominion.{%3) The pater familias owned all the family and its property (including staves); the pater
enforced matters involving interference with any property. The Commentaries of Gaius (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the Twelve Tables treated furtum (in
modern parlance: "theft") as a tort.

Similarly, assault and violent robbery involved trespass as to the pater's property (So, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the
pater as having trespassed on his "property"), and breach of such laws created a vinculum juris (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation
(modern "damages") could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated Teutonic laws of the Germanic tribes, included a complex system of monetary compensations for
what courts would now consider the complete!®ttion needecl range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down

Even though Rome abandoned its Britannic provinces around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries — who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in
Britannia — acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early Anglo-Saxon kings.35)
But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the Norman invasion, and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land
and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the “individual”, but also as a wrong against the "state" 261

This idea came from common law, and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the "state" had to usurp the usual
functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or privilegium against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and
arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to
raise money by selling a new form of writ). The development of the idea that the "state" dispenses justice in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence
of the concept of sovereignty.

In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.°7! Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on
‘smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman jurisprudence, but modified to meet the prevailing political climate

In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the things — the assemblies of the people. The people
decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most
esteemed men of the parish as his board, fuffiling the function of "the people" of yore

From the Hellenic system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of feuding
between clans and families. if compensation could mollify families’ feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played
down the threat of feudal warfare. Both in archaic Greece and in medieval Scandinavia, an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male
relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the United Nations Security Council, in which the veto power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does
not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.

‘These means of restraining private feuds did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfilment of justice. But in the earliest times the "state" did not always
provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as
crimes actually overlap with civi-law concepts.

‘The development of sociological thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of criminology
as a study of crime in society. Nietzsche noted a link between crime and creativity — in The Birth of Tragedy he asserted:("ee4s contex9 "The best and brightest that man
can acquire he must obtain by crime". In the 20th century, Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish made a study of criminalization as a coercive method of state control.
Causes and correlates
Main article: Causes and correlates of crime

Many different causes and correlates of crime have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and
behavioral factors. Controversial topics include media violence research and effects of gun politics.

Emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive
psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional
state declines.5] In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be
ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an
alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of
crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.5%
Religion

Main article: Religious law

See also: Category:Crimes in religion
Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the
perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that
may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for
example) alcohol consumption (prohibition), abortion and stem-cell research. In various historical and present-day societies,
institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against
specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic canon law and Islamic Shariah
Law.
Military jurisdictions and states of emergency

In the military sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as mutiny or desertion) under
martial-law codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.

Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a state of

emergency in case of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include assembly in the streets,
violation of curfew, or possession of firearms.

‘Two common types of employee crime exist: embezzlement and wage theft

brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.|571

In the United States, it is estimated!*Y """7] that $40 billion to $60 billion are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft.58 This compares to national annual losses of
$340 million due to robbery, $4.1 billion due to burglary, $5.3 billion due to larceny, and $3.8 billion due to auto theft in 2012.{5) in Singapore, as in the United States,
wage theft was found to be widespread and severe. In a 2014 survey it was found that as many as one-third of low wage male foreign workers in Singapore, or about

130,000, were affected by wage theft from partial to full denial of pay.)
