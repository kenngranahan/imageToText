Crinoline

"Crin" redirects here. For other uses, see Crin (disambiguation).

Accrinoline /'krmn.2l.1n/ is a stiff or structured petticoat designed to hold out a woman's skirt,
popular at various times since the mid-19th century. Originally, crinoline described a stiff fabric
made of horsehair ("erin") and cotton or linen which was used to make underskirts and as a
dress lining. The term crin or crinoline continues to be applied to a nylon stiffening tape used for
interfacing and lining hemlines in the 21st century.

By the 1850s the term crinoline was more usually applied to the fashionable silhouette provided
by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and
function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-
century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.

The steel-hooped cage erinoline, first patented in April 1856 by R.C. Millet in Paris, and by
their agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were
mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of
thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even
inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most
Popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although
by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller
crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline

Crinolines were worn by women of every social standing and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to widespread media scrutiny and

criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women died in the mid-19th century as a
result of their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles

‘The crinoline silhouette was revived several times in the 20th century, particularly in the late 1940s as a result of Christian Dior's "New Look" of 1947. The flounced
nylon and net petticoats worn in the 1950s and 1960s to poof out skirts also became known as crinolines even when there were no hoops in their construction. In the
mid-1980s Vivienne Westwood designed the mini-crini, a mini-length crinoline which was highly influential on 1980s fashion. Late 20th and early 21st century designers
such as John Galliano and Alexander McQueen have become famous for their updated crinoline designs. Since the 1980s and well into the 21st century the crinoline

has remained a popular option for formal evening dresses, wedding dresses, and ball gowns

Etymology
The name crinoline is often described as a combination of the Latin word crinis ("hair") and/or the French word erin ("horsehair"); with
the Latin word Jinum ("thread” or "flax," which was used to make linen), describing the materials used in the original textile {11218141

In the 21st century, the term crin is still used to describe a type of woven nylon flat braid, available in various widths and used for
stiffening and providing bulk-free body to hemlines, serving the same purpose as the original crin/crinoline.1l Crin tape/trim is typically
transparent, though it also comes in black, white and cream colors. It is also described as horsehair braid or crinoline tape.
Pre-1850

The crinoline was not the first garment designed to support the wearer's skirts in a fashionable shape. Whilst
the bell-shaped skirts seen on statuettes from the ancient Minoan civilization are often compared to crinolines,
particularly under the assumption that hoops were required to retain their shape, there is no evidence to
confirm this and the theory is usually dismissed.(711°

The crinoline's ancestors are more typically recognised as the Spanish verdugada, later known as the
farthingale, widely worn in Europe from the late 15th century to the early 17th century, and the side-hoops and
panniers worn throughout the 18th century.(1it0It11)

The horsehair fabric called crinoline was first noted by 1829, when it was offered for lining and dress-
making.""2] That year, Rudolph Ackermann's Repository of Fashions described the new textile as a “fine clear

stuff, not unlike in appearance to leno, but of a very strong and durable description: it is made in different (ET) 1860s (MET)

colours; grey, and the colour of unbleached cambric are most in favour."('3)

Petticoats made of horsehair crinoline appeared around 1839, proving so successful that the name ‘crinoline’ began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather
than solely to the material.!"4l By 1847, crinoline fabric was being used as a stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric
petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts.!"5] One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down
or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury.!"®] However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s." In about 1849, it was
possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as ‘crinoline’, and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textle.("7I The artificial
crinotine with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.{15]
Late 19th century

1850s-60s

The cage crinoline made out of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline
(described as a "skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape") granted in July 1856.!"8II"9] alison Gernsheim suggests that the
unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besancon, as the July 1856 patent was fled by their British agent, C. Amet.{18]
Millet had already patented a ‘tournure de femme" in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising "elastic extensible circles
joined together by vertical bands.""8] Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about
the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue.°l Diana de Marly, in her
biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth, noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline
manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines.2"] One of the most significant manufacturers of crinolines was that of
Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four
thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million Cage crinoline with steel &
crinolines over a twelve-year period.2] in 1859, the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000 yards Cosy Kee)
(270,000 m) of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas &

Sherwood factory in Manhattan used one ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts 221

The crinoline needed to be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be
temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards.!4] Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-
percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber).!25) The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily
punctured, prone to collapse, and due to the use of brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant.!25)
Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering
their form.5] Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, 5] lightweight steel was clearly the
most successful option.'4! It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of
the legs.”4] However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended.241 An
advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the
potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs
and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.281

Despite some claims, such as that by the historian Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to 10 yards (30 ft)
around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between 5.5-6
yards (5.0-5.5 m).271 whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage,
Gernsheim noted that 10 yards (9.1 m) hems were highly improbable.26] Staged photographs showing women wearing
exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a
woman dressing with the assistance of several maids who require long poles to lit her dress over her head and other ingenious
means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt.7°! Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than
accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline
often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many
crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage
crinolines in the Museum's collection."

Crinolettes and 1880s revival
The crinoline began to fall out of fashion from about 1866. A modified version, the crinolette, was a transitional garment
bridging the gap between the cage crinoline and the bustle. Fashionable from 1867 through to the mid-1870s, the crinolette was
typically composed of half-hoops, sometimes with internal lacing or ties designed to allow adjustment of fullness and shape.3")
The crinolette was stil worn in the early 1880s, with an 1881 article describing it as sticking out solely behind, as opposed to
projecting "hideously at the side" ke the crinoline.©21 It is possible that some of the smaller crinolines that survive were worn in
combination with separate bustles, rather than in isolation.) During the 1880s the cage crinoline was revived, with hoop
petticoats designed to accommodate the extremely large bustles of the period and support the skirt hems.°! One of the
mid-1880s styles was called the lobster pot due to its resemblance to a lobster trap.5] Due to the extreme weight of the fabrics
of the decade, the hoops of the crinolines were crossed over each other behind the legs in order to support and hold the skirts
firmly in place.) As with the earlier cage crinolines, sprung steel, wire and cane were used.{331
Critical response

Unlike the farthingales and panniers, the crinoline was worn by women of every social class. The fashion swiftly became the
‘subject of intense scrutiny in Western media.!4I5I Critical articles on the crinoline were published by the Hungarian journal Az
Ust6k6s (1858) and the Bulgarian journalist Petko Slaveykov in 1864.'°41 in the 1850s, the Welsh poet Dafydd Jones wrote a
ballad decrying the fashion.(°41°8 4 similar sentiment was expressed by a Russian song published in 1854, where the singer
complains about his wife having assumed the fashion.4] In 1855, an observer of Queen Victoria's state visit to Paris complained
that despite the number of foreigners present, Western fashions such as the crinoline had diluted national dress to such an
extent that everyone, whether Turkish, Scottish, Spanish or Tyrolean, dressed alike.°71 Victoria herself is popularly said to have
detested the fashion, inspiring a song in Punch that started: "Long live our gracious Queen/Who won't wear crinotine!"8I99) Caricature showing a lady scolding ©
Gernsheim has noted that the Queen was often photographed in crinolines, and suggests that this misunderstanding came from _hef maid for wearing a crinoline.

a request made by Victoria that female guests attending her daughter's marriage in 1858 should leave their hoops off due to eee

limited space in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace{"1]

The crinoline was perceived as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the
higher-class ladies' disapproval.!4°! The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual
published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work.!#1I As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops
rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by.'*] Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their
fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work.!*] However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control
their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.{4")

‘Arthur Munby observed that in the "barbarous locality" of Wigan, the sight of a female colliery worker wearing trousers was “not half as
odd as a woman wearing a crinoline," exposing his own upper-class attitudes (201 In Australia, poorer rural women were photographed
posing outside their slab huts, wearing their best dresses with crinolines.'*2] The French sociologist and economist Frédéric le Play
carried out surveys of French working-class families' wardrobes from 1850 to 1875, in which he found that two women had crinolines in
their wardrobe, both wives of skilled workers.!“3) One, the fashion-conscious wife of a glove-maker, owned two crinolines and eleven
dresses, although her usual everyday clothing consisted of wooden shoes and printed aprons.'*3] In America, the mid-19th century
crinoline has become popularly associated with the image of the Southern Belle, a young woman from the American Deep South's upper
socioeconomic, slave-owning planter classes.'*4] However, as in Europe and elsewhere, the crinoline was far from exclusively worn by
wealthy white women.{45) Both black and white women in America of all classes and social standings wore hooped skirts, including First
Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and her African-American dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckley, who created many of Lincoln's own extravagant
crinolines. {#411451

The difficulties associated with the garment, such as its size, the problems and hazards associated with wearing and moving about in it,
and the fact that it was worn so widely by women of all social classes, were frequently exaggerated and parodied in satirical articles and
illustrations such as those in Punch.!241135] Alexander Maxwell has summarised crinoline mockery as expressing the male authors’
insecurity and fears that women, whose crinolines took up "enough space for five," would eventually "conquer" mankind.!4] Julia
‘Thomas, observing the extent of Punch's anti-crinoline sentiment and mockery, noted that the magazine's attacks, rather than crushing the fashion, exacerbated and
even invented the phenomenon of "crinolinemania."(25]

Hazards

The flammability of the crinoline was widely reported. Although trustworthy statistics on crinoline-related fatalities are rare, Florence
Nightingale estimated that at least 630 women died from their clothes catching fire in 1863—1864."*8lI47] One such incident, the death of a
14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, “distended by a crinoline,”
ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace to reach some spoons on the mantelpiece, and she died as a result of extensive
burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more
conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General,” passed a verdict of "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline."“1 4

Other risks associated with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing
the wearer off her feet.271 in 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the
entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.!271S31

The crinoline was worn by some factory workers, leading to the textiles firm Courtaulds instructing female employees in 1860 to leave their hoops and crinolines at
home.41 Cecil Willett Cunnington described seeing a photograph of female employees in the Bryant and May match factories wearing crinolines while at work.!541 4

2oth century

During World War |, the "war crinoline” became fashionable, between 1915 and 1917.4 This style featured wide, full mid-calf length S$
skirts, and was described as practical (for enabling freedom of walking and movement) and pattiotic, as the sight of attractively dressed
women was expected to cheer up soldiers on leave.'57I58l The full skirts of the war crinoline endured in the robe de style of the 1920s.'591

In the late 1930s, just before the outbreak of World War Il, there was a revival of the hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward
Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, ©! and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired

crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with

having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion.!®1I62] Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the

traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions.!©I The film Gone With The Wind, released

in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.41

Following World War Il, crinolines were once again revived by designers such as Christian Dior, whose
1947 "New Look" featured full skirts supported by stiffened underskirts.{®51164 Loschek has suggested
that, by explicitly referencing the Belle Epoque era and reviving historic styles of corsets and crinolines in
his "New Look," Dior was the first designer to introduce the idea of postmodernism to fashion, albeit
unconsciously.!67! Crinolines were popular throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s. The American designer Anne Fogarty was
particularly noted for her full-skirted designs worn over crinoline petticoats, which were always separate garments from the dress to
enable ease of movement and travelling.'®8l Life reported in 1953 on how one of Fogarty's crinoline designs from 1951 was almost
exactly duplicated by a design in Dior's latest collection {521 Hooped, tiered and/or ruffled crinoline petticoats in nylon, net and cotton
were widely worn, as were skirts with integrated hoops.!70lI7")

War crinoline, 1916

In the mid-1980s Vivienne Westwood revisited the crinoline, taking inspiration from the ballet Petrushka
to produce miniskirt length versions that she christened the "mini-crini."”2] The mini-crini silhouette
influenced the work of other designers such as Christian Lacroix's "puffball" skirts.73] The Westwood,
mini-crini was described in 1989 as a combination of two conflicting ideals — the crinoline, representing a

"mythology of restriction and encumbrance," and the miniskirt, representing an "mythology of
Dior evening gown and = ineration. 741
crinoline petticoat, 1954 (V&A)

Late 20th- and early 21st-century fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen and John Galliano

often used crinolines in their designs, with the skirt of one of Galliano’s ballgowns for Dior in 1998
reaching a width of 9 feet.51 Galliano specifically visited the original crinoline manufacturers that Christian Dior himself had used in
‘order to inform and influence his own designs.!761 McQueen was fascinated by the crinoline and offen referenced it in his collections,
cutting away leather ballgowns to reveal the cage beneath, or making it out of silver-decorated cut metal.!"7! One of McQueen's most
notable crinoline designs was modelled by the amputee model Aimee Mullins in a series of photographs by Nick Knight for Dazed and
Confused, in which Mullin’s cage crinoline, deliberately worn without overskirts in order to reveal her prosthetic legs, was described as
suggesting both a walking frame and a cage to “contain the unruliness of the unwhole" 178175] The images from this shoot were declared Westwood's ‘mini-crin,
among the most significant commercial images of 1998, representing Knight and McQueen's dedication to presenting alternatives tothe 1987
traditional concepts of fashion and physical beauty.8°] after McQueen's death in 2010, his successor, Sarah Burton, continued the

tradition of designing crinolines for the McQueen brand./8")
Crinolines continue to be worn well into the 21st century, typically as part of formal outfits such as evening gowns, prom dresses,
quinceafiera dresses, and wedding dresses.!®21 1950s and 1960s style net crinolines are a traditional element of costumes for square
dancing and clogging.!*31®41 They are also popular garments for attending 1950s and 1960s influenced rockabilly events such as Viva
Las Vegas.!851 The steampunk movement has also appropriated cage crinolines along with other elements of 19th century fashion such
as corsets and the top hat for its costuming.{°"1861

In some contexts, the traditional hooped crinoline may be seen as controversial, as in early 2015 when
the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to
their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of
the American Deep South.!*I®2I871 The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism
incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the
University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity '#I451°71 jt was noted that hoop
skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings
during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to

the image of the Southern Belle.{*41I45] ‘Wedding dress, 2005 ©
