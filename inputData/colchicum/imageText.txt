Common names

‘The common names autumn crocus, meadow saffron and naked lady may be applied to the whole genus or to many of its
species; they refer to the "naked" crocus-lke flowers that appear in late summer or autumn, long before the strap-like foliage
which appears in spring

Colenicum and Crocus look alike and can be confused by the casual observer. To add to the confusion, there are autumn-
flowering species of crocus. However, colchicums have 3 styles and 6 stamens, while crocuses have 1 style and 3 stamens.4! In
addition, the corm structures are quite different—in Colchicum, the corm is irregular, while in crocuses, the corm is like a
flattened ball.§1 Crocus is in the iris family, Iridaceae.
Etymology

The name of the genus derives from KoAyic (Colchis), the Ancient Greek name for the region of gexnbo0 (Kolkhida) in
modern Georgia (Caucasus). Colchis features in Greek mythology as the land to which the Argonauts journeyed in quest of the
golden fleece and where Jason encountered Medea. The Greek toponym Colchis is thought by scholars to derive from the
Urartian Quipa, pronounced "Kolcha" (guttural "ch" - as in Scots /och).{®

Relationships

Colenicum melanthioides, also known as Androcymbium melanthioides,” is probably the best known species from the tropical
regions. in contrast to most temperate colchicums, the flower and leaves are produced at the same time, the white flowers
usually in a small corymb that is enclosed by white bracts. Close relatives such as Colchicum scabromarginatum (Androcymbium
scabromarginatum) and Colchicum coloratum (Androcymbium burchellil) have flowers with very short stalks and may be
pollinated by rodents./8)
