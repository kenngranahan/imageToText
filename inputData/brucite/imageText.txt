Discovery

Brucite was first described in 1824 by Francois Sulpice Beudant®l and named for the discoverer, American mineralogist,
Archibald Bruce (1777-1818). A fibrous variety of brucite is called nemalite. It occurs in fibers or laths, usually elongated
along [1010], but sometimes [1120] crystalline directions
Occurrence

‘Anotable location in the U.S. is Wood's Chrome Mine, Cedar Hill Quarry, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Yellow, white
and blue Brucite with a botryoidal habit was discovered in Gila Saifullan District of Province Baluchistan, Pakistan. And then
ina later discovery Brucite also occurred in the Bela Ophiolite of Wadh, Khuzdar District, Province Baluchistan, Pakistan
Brucite has also occurred from South Africa, Italy, Russia, Canada, and other localities as well but the most notable
discoveries are the US, Russian and Pakistani examples.
Industrial applications

Synthetic brucite is mainly consumed as a precursor to magnesia (MgO), a useful refractory insulator. It finds some use as
a flame retardant because it thermally decomposes to release water in a similar way to aluminium hydroxide and mixtures of
huntite and hydromagnesite.!7 [t also constitutes a significant source of magnesium for industry. Although generally
deemed safe, brucite can be contaminated with naturally occurring asbestos fibers.1
Magnesium attack of cement and concrete

When cement or concrete are exposed to Mg?*, the neoformation of brucite, an expansive material, may induce mechanical
stress in the hardened cement paste or may clog the porous system creating a buffering effect and delaying deterioration
of the CSH phase into MSH phase. The exact magnitude of impact that brucite has over cement paste is still debatable
Prolonged contact between sea water or brines and concrete may induce durability issue although high concentrations are
required for this effect, which are rare to find in nature.

The use of dolomite as aggregate in concrete can also cause magnesium attack and should be avoided
