Recording

Grohl and Jones produced the record across a period of one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all
instruments. Both would arrive in the morning at Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a

day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, "still sweating and shaking Caine CEASA
from playing drums and [then] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have @-—— werent even real words"
sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song”. The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on "X-Static”
provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if
he wanted to play and handed him a guitar!" Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions
were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was "tll Stick Around".®) Grohl
was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in "Floaty",!""! and tried to enhance the performance through double track — "You know how people
double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled."®1

“The first Foo Fighters record was not meant to

—Dave Grohl in 201112)

In an attempt to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters.” It would be a very low-key release, with only 100 LP records
being pressed after the sessions were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started
handing them to friends for feedback and "I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would come up to me and say ‘Nirvana was my favourite band’ and I'd say 'well here, have
this" !"2] Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast.”] The recordings quickly circulated
amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend
of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.'51!"3)

The mixing sessions of the album began in Robert Lang Studios (which were used on the 100 tapes Grohl gave away) but eventually those mixes were discarded and
the sessions moved to Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock's "The Shop" studio in Arcata, California. Mixes were done on a 32 channel API DeMedio console, custom built
by Frank DeMedio in 1972 for Wally Heider Recording's 'Studio 4’. A Stephen's 24 track 2" tape machine was used for playback. Processors used in the mixes included
an Eventide Omnipressor compressor for vocals and guitar solos, an Alan Smart stereo compressor for "squashing" the drums and mixing them back in as well as being
used over the entire mix. Other processors included UREI 1176 and LA3A compressors as well as an Echoplex for delays and a “crappy digital reverb". Mixes were
“nothing that crazy" Rob described, adding that he "mixed 'Big Me' in 20 minutes" {"4)

During the sessions, Grohl was invited by Tom Petty to perform with The Heartbreakers on Saturday Night Live one month later. The performance was followed by an
invitation to be a full-time member of the Heartbreakers, but once Petty heard about the Foo Fighters, he instead encouraged Grohl to move on with this solo project.!"51
Grohl soon recruited a full band, which included bassist Nate Mendel and drummer Wiliam Goldsmith of the recently disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as
Nirvana touring guitarist, and former Germs member, Pat Smear.)

Music and composition

Nine of the songs in the album were composed before or during Groh's tenure with Nirvana, and existed in demos Til Stick Around
created by Grohl on his home 8-track tape recorder.'5! The only compositions done after Cobain's death were
"This Is a Call", "ll Stick Around”, "X-Static” and "Wattershed”.(5116] The album's sound has been primarily

Most of the lyrics on Foo Fighters are nonsensical lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began.22! As Groh later explained, "I had seven days to
record fifteen songs. | was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent
sitting in a chair thinking."®"6 Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that "there was too much to say" following Cobain's death and "a lot of emphasis
[was] placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album."‘"5! Groh! still considered that "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now | look
at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning",5ll'6l and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by "personal experiences of the last four or five
years", with the standout being "Big Me", an “out-and-out love song" to Groh's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album."t
Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as "This Is a Call", defined as “a ‘hello’ and a ‘thank you" to
everyone that had played a key role in Groh''s life) the playful "For All the Cows"; and "Watershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Gron's
“love of hardcore and old school punk rock" {2
Packaging

The name "Foo Fighters" was taken from the description World War Il aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs."SI This science fiction theme is further
continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of
1947; and the album cover done by Groht's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol.5! Some reviewers
considered the gun on the cover as insensitive,(4 given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence.II'§l Goldsmith
later explained, "It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. I's really a completely
separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that."®II'6l Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of
the full band that Grohl had recruited.251
Release and promotion

In spring 1995, Foo Fighters embarked on their first ever United States tour, supporting Mike Watt on his Ring Spiel Tour along with fellow tour newbies Hovercraft,
whose line-up included Vedder at the time.!5! As well as performing with their own bands, Grohl and Vedder each picked up a role as a member of Watt's backing band
throughout the tour, supplying drums and guitar respectively. in May 1995, radio stations KROG-FM and KNDD started playing some tracks of the then-unreleased
album before receiving a cease-and-desist from Capitol. That June, "Exhausted" and "This Is a Call" were sent to college and modern rock radio stations.{"9] One week
later, "This Is a Call" became the band's first commercial single.!231

Foo Fighters was released July 4, 1995 on Roswell Records, distributed by Capitol Records. The band promoted the release that summer by completing another US
tour with Wool and Shudder to Think, with 25 concerts in little over a month. Foo Fighters also made their network television debut on the Late Show with David
Letterman on August 14, performing "This Is a Call’. Afterwards, the band played several of their largest shows up to that point, making their debut on the European
festival circuit with performances at Pukkelpop, Reading and Lowlands.(25]

“Ill Stick Around” was issued as the second single on September 4, 1995 and would also mark Foo Fighters’ music video debut, directed by Gerald Casale. That fall, the
band continued to tour extensively,5 with a European tour with Built to Spill,’27] and visits to Japan, Australia and New Zealand.!25) The tour was wrapped with a
performance at the Phoenix Festival on July 20, 1996. The Foo Fighters performed nearly 100 concerts throughout 1995, and over 70 dates the following year.251
‘Three more songs of the album were issued as singles: "For All the Cows" in 1995,!8] and both "Big Me" and "Alone + Easy Target” in 1996.9! "Big Me" was the first
commercial single made available in the US, and the second song from the album to see release as a music video, a parody of the Mentos television commercials
directed by Jesse Peretz 30]
