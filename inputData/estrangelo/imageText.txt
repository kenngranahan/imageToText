There are three major variants of the Syriac alphabet: “Estrangéla, Madnhay and Serta ean x :

East Syriac Madnhaya
The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the Madnhdya (etiioxn, 'Eastern’) form of the alphabet. Other names for the script
include Swadayé (r<ésié, ‘conversational’ or ‘vernacular’, often translated as ‘contemporary’, reflecting its use in writing modern
Neo-Aramaic), “Atoraya (eiahv<, ‘Assyrian’, not to be confused with the traditional name for the Hebrew alphabet), Kaldéya
(<a, ‘Chaldean’), and, inaccurately, "Nestorian" (a term that was originally used to refer to the Church of the East in the
Sasanian Empire). The Eastern script resembles ‘Estrangélé somewhat more closely than the Western script.

Vowels

‘The Eastern script uses a system of dots above and/or below letters, based on an older system, to indicate vowel sounds not
found in the script

‘+ A dot above and a dot below a letter represent [a], transliterated as a or 4 (called cia, pana), as

+ Two diagonally-placed dots above a letter represent [a], transliterated as 4 or 4 or 4 (called <a, 29408), ‘Adth century Estrangéla a

Itis thought that the Eastern method for representing vowels influenced the development of the niqqud markings used for writing
Hebrew.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes 9, é or superscript © (or often nothing at all) to
represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac. Some transliteration
‘schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons. Whether because its distribution is Men SI
mostly predictable (usually inside a syllable-initial two-consonant cluster) or because its pronunciation was lost, both the East manuscript from the Vatican Library

and the West variants of the alphabet traditionally have no sign to represent the schwa. Note the title writen in ‘Estrangéla.

West Syriac Serta

‘The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the Serta or Serto (rs, 'line') form of the alphabet, also known as the Psité e \ ( \ Y >

(rL,a, 'simple’), ‘Maronite’ or the \Jacobite' script (although the term Jacobite is considered derogatory). Most of the letters are 535.55 786: the Syiacnameof | ©
clearly derived from ‘Estrangéla, but are simplified, flowing lines. A cursive chancery hand is evidenced in the earliest Syriac Jesus in the ‘Estrangélé script
manuscripts, but important works were written in 'Estrangéla. From the sth century, the simpler Serta style came into fashion,

perhaps because of its more economical use of parchment.
Vowels
The Western script is usually vowel-pointed, with miniature Greek vowel letters above or below the letter which they
follow:

+ (Capital alpha (A) represents [a], transliterated as a or 4 (ihe, plana),

+ () Lowercase alpha (a) represents [a], transliterated as 4 or 4 or 4 (r<&ax, 29404: pronounced as [0] and
transliterated as o in the West Syriac dialect),

+ (@) Lowercase epsilon (e) represents both [e}, transliterated as e or &, and [e], transliterated as € (e< 5%,

Summary table

The Syriac alphabet consists of the following letters, shown in their isolated (non-connected) forms. When isolated, the letters Kap,
mim, and man are usually shown with their initial form connected to their final form (see below). The letters “lep, dailat, né, waw, zayn,
sad6, ré§ and taw (and, in early ‘Estrangéla manuscripts, the letter semkaf®l) do not connect to a following letter within a word; these
are marked with an asterisk (*).

‘The Syriac alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0. Additional letters for Suriyani Malayalam were added in
June, 2017 with the release of version 10.0
