History Cognac
Modern flambéing became popular in the 19th century. The English Christmas pudding was served flaming in Charles Dickens!
1843 novel, A Christmas Carol: "the pudding... blazing in halt of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy". The most common flambé dish appears to have been sweet omelette
with rum or kirsch; for example, Alexis Soyer’s 1846 cookbook, The Gastronomic Regenerator, gives a recipe for Omelette au Rhum: "...the moment of going to table
pour three glasses of rum round and set it on fire".{5] Ida Joscelyne's book, The Marvellous Little Housekeepers (1880), mentions both rum and kirsch;!) another recipe
appears in A.G. Payne's English cookbook, Choice Dishes at Small Cost, of 1882: "Make a sweet omelet, and heat a tablespoonful of kirsch, by holding a light under the
spoon. As soon as the spirit catches fire pour it round the omelet, and serve flaming."\"l Perhaps the most famous flambé dish, Crépe Suzette, was supposedly invented
in 1895 as an accident [6]
Procedure

Cognac, rum, or other flavorful liquors that are about 40% alcohol (80 USA proof) are considered ideal for flambé."" Wines and
beers have too litle alcohol and will not flambé. High-alcohol liquors, such as Bacardi 151 or Everclear, are highly flammable and
considered too dangerous by professional cooks. Cinnamon is sometimes added not only for flavor but for show, as the powder
ignites when added.{10)

The alcoholic beverage must be heated before lighting it on fire. This is because at room temperature, the liquid is stil below the
flash point, and there are not enough alcoholic vapors to ignite. By heating it, the vapor pressure increases, releasing enough
vapors to catch fire from the match.tt
Effects on taste

Flambéing reduces the alcohol content of the food modestly. In one experimental model, about 25% of the alcohol was boiled of.
The effects of the flames are also modest: although the temperature within the flame may be quite high (over 500 °C), the
temperature at the surface of the pan is lower than that required for a Maillard browning reaction or for caramelization.!"21
‘Whether or not there is a change in flavor as result of
flambéing is unclear. Some claim that because the flame is
above the food, and since hot gases rise, it cannot

occasionally even a waiter's thumb. The people seem

significantly affect the flavor. Indeed, experimental work {0 like it and it doesn't harm the food much

‘shows that most people cannot tell the difference."7I That — Ernest Byfield
said, in an informal taste test conducted by the Los Angeles The Pump Room, Chicago
Times of two batches of caramelized apples (one flambéed 1950113)

and one simmered), one tester declared the "flambéed dish

Flambéing in a skillet a

was for adults, the other for kids"{"° Others, however, dispute this and quote celebrated French chefs who claim that flambéing is strictly a show-biz aspect of restaurant

business that ruins food but is done to create an impressive visual presentation at a dramatic point in the preparation of a meal.{'4)
Safety

For safety, it is recommended that alcohol not be added to a pan on a burner, and that the cook use a long fireplace match to ignite the pan!*)
