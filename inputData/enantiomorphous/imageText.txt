Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left
handedness, according to the right-hand rule.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as
gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each
other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them inside-

The J, L, S and Z-shaped tetrominoes of the popular video game Tetris also exhibit chirality,
but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane
Chirality and symmetry group

‘A figure is achiral if and only if its symmetry group contains at least one orientation-reversing isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any isometry can be written as

++ Av + bwith an orthogonal matrix A and a vector b. The determinant of A is either 1 or -1 then. If it is -1 the isometry is orientation-reversing, otherwise it is
orientation-preserving

‘A general definition of chirality based on group theory exists." It does not refer to any orientation concept: an isometry is direct if and only if itis a product of squares of
isometries, and if not, it is an indirect isometry. The resulting chirality definition works in spacetime.7I1
Chirality in three dimensions

In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a mirror plane of symmetry S;, an inversion center of symmetry So, or a
higher improper rotation (rotoreflection) S, axis of symmetry"! is achiral. (A plane of symmetry of a figure F is a plane P,

such that Fis invariant under the mapping (z, y, 2) > («,y, ~2), when P is chosen to be the #-y-plane of the

coordinate system. A center of symmetry of a figure F is a point C, such that F is invariant under the mapping

(x,y, 2) > (—2, -y, —2), when C is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral
figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

Fy = {(1,0,0), (0,1, 0), (—1, 0,0), (0, -1, 0), (2, 1,1), (—1, 2, —1), (—2, -1, 1), (1, -2, -1)}

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry (x,y, 2) -> (—y,.,—z) and thus achiral, but it has neither plane

nor center of symmetry. The figure
Fy = {(1,0,0), (-1, 0,0), (0,2, 0), (0, -2,0), (1,1,1), (-1,-1, -1)}
also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Achiral figures can have a center axis
-2,—-1,1), (1,—2, -1)}

2) and thus achiral, but it has neither plane
Knot theory

Akknot is called achiral if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a chiral knot. For example,
the unknot and the figure-eight knot are achiral, whereas the trefoil knot is chiral
