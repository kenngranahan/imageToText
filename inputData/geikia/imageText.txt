Geikia locusticeps skull, showing ©
large orbits and shortened face.

Ahigh level of skull specialization was significant in the classification of Geikia.!! Maisch
and Gebauer considered the squared off anterior snout tip and reduced exposure of
‘squamosal in occiput to be characteristics exclusively expressed in Geikia.! Prior to
their analysis, Rowe described the generic diagnosis of Geikia as “dicynodonts having
no tusk or postcanine teeth; highly vaulted palate; anterior palatal ridges of premaxilla
reduced or absent; large palatine having rugose palatal surface: palatine having
extensive contact with maxilla and premaxilla; length of interpterygoidal vacuity not less
than half the length of the interpterygoidal fossa: interpterygoidal vacuity lying entirely
within roof of interpterygoidal fossa; well developed maxillary caniniform process having
pronounced lateral ridge; sharp occlusal margin of beak; sharp ridge or “kee!” developed
on central edge of maxilla behind caniniform process; septomaxilla having exposure on

lateral surface of snout behind external nares; anterior surface of premaxilla flat, oriented vertically, and meeting lateral surface
of premaxilla in abrupt “corner”; single, prominent preorbital protuberance" {4)
Discovery and naming

This genus was established in 1893 following Edwin Tulley Newton's discovery of a new dicynodont fossil, now known as G.
elginensis, one of the Elgin Reptiles found near Elgin in Scotland.!°] Newton discovered this specimen in conjunction with other
new reptiles, but believed that G. elginensis’ characteristics were sufficiently unique to justify a new genus.(I The holotype is the
‘only known occurrence, and is housed at the Institute of Geological Sciences in London. {61l4)

There have been two occurrences of the second species, G. Jocusticeps, both from the Ruhuhu Basin of Tanzania. Originally

discovered by Friedrich von Huene in 1942.41 they are housed at the Institut und Museum flr Geologie und Palaontologie der
Universitat Tubingen./2)

Early 20th century reconstruction of |
The name Geikia was proposed by E.T. Newton, who investigated the G. elginensis holotype in 1892.(5] This name was a Geikia and Sclerosaurus by F. John

dedication to Sir Archibald Geikie, the Director-General of the Geological Survey at the time.!5]

Specimens

The only G. elginensis specimen is a natural mold of a nearly complete skull and mandible, associated left humerus, and an isolated metapodial or proximal phalanx.!#]
The G. locusticeps holotype is a skull lacking the tip of premaxilla, right quadrate, left temporal arch, and mandible.4I Two occurrences of this species exist in the fossil
record.!7l Analyses of G. elginensis and G. locusticeps indicate affinities to each other, but each also shares many characteristics with other taxa, including
Pelanomodon, Oudenodon, and Ptychognathus (Lystrosaurus).21514I31 The absence of some expected characteristics in G. elginensis could be explained under the
assumption that itis subadult and, therefore, not fully developed.! However, ontogenetic changes of both Gelkia and Pelanomodon, which would enable better
analyses, remain uncertain.
Classification

G. locusticeps was recognized as Dicynodon locusticeps until Timothy Rowe referred it to Geikia in 1980.2l\41 it has been suggested that G. /ocusticeps may be a
Juvenile Pelanomodon tuberosus, and the two have been used synonymously.”! in 2005, it was proposed that P. tuberosus be referred to G. locusticeps as a junior
‘subjunctive synonym.2)

Both belonging to the family Gelkiidae, the genera Pelanomodon and Geikia are closely related.'2I Morphological differences between G. elginensis and G. locusticeps,
as well as individual similarities to other species (especially those within Pelanomodon) have been utilized in debates regarding their classifications.I This exemplifies,
unresolved aspects of dicynodont taxonomy; it has even been suggested that single or incomplete dicynodont specimens should be considered incertae seals until
conclusions can be better ascertained through additional specimens or better preparation.["! More recent literature attributes the cross-genus similarities between
Pelanomodon and Geikia to plesiomorphic geikiid traits. 2! with these considerations, it is currently maintained that the generic distinction of Geikia is warranted.)
Paleobiology

Compared to other dicynodonts, the shortened skull could be indicative of specific herbivory habits, such as biting off small pieces of vegetation.(*! Pertaining to
mastication, crushing action was likely more emphasized than slicing, due to structural limitations of lower jaw movement. Additionally, these limitations could have
conferred a "selective browser" role upon Geikia.(I®1 Aside from jaw specialization, the forward position and large size of the orbits could suggest a degree of
‘stereoscopic vision."! Rotational ability of the eyes could have enabled Geikia to see in a variety of directions, such as through notches in the frontals."I Cruickshank
indicated that these characteristics, along with the loss of tusks, could be suggestive of nocturnal behaviors.
Paleoecology

G. elginensis was discovered in the Cutties Hillock Sandstone Formation in Scotland.!! The coarse, hard sand presented difficulty in the development of the specimen, 1
which was recovered from a pebbly layer near the base of the formation.(21 The pebbles are characteristic of water deposition, suggesting a fluvial environment.!7]
Analyses have suggested that this formation is of Permian age, specifically Late Tatarian.!] Assuming accuracy of age assessment, this could be representative of
offshore Zechstein Sea deposits.!71

Also estimated to be of Tatarian age, G. /ocusticeps was discovered in the Usili Formation (formerly Kawinga Formation) of Kingori in southwest Tanzania." The
environment was identified as being terrestrial"! in a 2010 publication, Sidor et al. concluded that subsidence events during this time conferred a transition from alluvial
fans to an axial braided channel, ultimately equilibrating as an alluvial plain with rivers and lakes. (10)
