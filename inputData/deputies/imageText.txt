Overview

The political theory of the separation of powers requires legislators to be independent individuals from the members of the
executive and the judiciary. Certain political systems adhere to this principle, others do not. In the United Kingdom, for
example, the executive is formed almost exclusively from legislators (members of Parliament) although the judiciary is
mostly independent (until reforms in 2005, the Lord Chancellor uniquely was a legislator, a member of the executive -
indeed, the Cabinet - and a judge, while until 2009 the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were both judges and legislators as
members of the House of Lords, though by convention they did not vote in the House until retirement).

In continental European jurisprudence and legal discussion, "the legislator” (le /égislateur) is the abstract entity that has
produced the laws. When there is room for interpretation, the intent of the legislator will be questioned, and the court is
directed to rule in the direction it judges to best fit the legislative intent, which can be difficult in the case of conflicting laws
or constitutional provisions.
Substitute legislator

Some legislatures provide each legislator with an official "substitute legislator’ who deputises for the legislator in the legislature if the elected representative is,
unavailable. Venezuela, for example, provides for substitute legislators (diputado suplente) to be elected under Article 186 of its 1999 constitution.(7] Ecuador, Panama,
and the U.S. state of Idaho also have substitute legislators.{@)
